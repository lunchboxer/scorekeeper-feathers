# scorekeeper-feathers

> A real-time classroom scorekeeper api server

## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications. It currently only has datamodels, authentication, and CRUD operations, nothing interesting yet.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. You'll need a running mongodb server and that config/default.json matches your setup.

2. Install your dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
